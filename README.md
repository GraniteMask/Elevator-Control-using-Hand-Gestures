# Elevator-Control-using-Hand-Gestures
This project is all about effective controlling a elevator/lift without touching its buttons and only using hand gestures for inputs about floor numbers. The code has been written in python and Spider IDE has been used. This feature will be extremely useful to maintain Social Distancing during this COVID-19 Pandemic.

## Highlighted Features:

1) User can use hand gestures to give inputs about the floor numbers
2) Special Gestures have been made to give critical inputs like 'Floor Confirmation'

## Technologies and Libraries I used:

1) Python OpenCV library
2) Python NumPy library
3) Python Math library
4) Spider IDE and Anaconda
5) A good Camera!!!

NOTE: The code cannot be provided at this moment as this is my University Project. Also there are some technicalities, once they are cleared I will upload the code. So till that time....Stay tuned....

Although, I can show you the output ScreenShots....
